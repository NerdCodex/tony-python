Lexer Version 3:

syntax:
    define Function{
        io.print("Hello World")
    }
    
    !Function  --->  To Call The Function

Features:
    We Can Create a function as Like python, java, c and c++
    We Have introduced Error Class for "()".
    The Error Example:
    code:
        define start{
            io.print("Hello World"
        }
     Error:
          Line 2
          ')' is missing


Drawback:
    We could not able to call a single function when we have more than on Function
    Example:
        define function{
            io.print("Hello World")
        }
        
        define printer{
            io.print("Printing hello World")
        }
        
        !printer
        
        Output:
            HelloWorld
            PrintinghelloWorld
    
    Note:
        Still The Error class is not Defined for Strings and brackets
